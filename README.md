# SpectraGuru - Spectra Analysis Application

*SpectraGuru is currently under development! Thank you for your patience.*

Find our documentation page: [here](https://fengboma.github.io/docs.spectraguru/)!

## What is SpectraGuru?
SpectraGuru is a spectra analysis application designed to provide user-friendly tools for processing and visualizing spectra, aimed at accelerating your research. It functions as a dashboard or a specialized tool within a Python environment, organized with various modular functions that allow users to process spectroscopy data in a pipeline. SpectraGuru is based on the Python streamlit framework.
